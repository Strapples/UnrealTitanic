# UnrealTitanic
This is a fork of Unreal Tournament with customized missions and story gameplay. A customized map will be used. Original UT source based

This game is NOT in development yet.

Current Development - Acquire and build a mod using open source community assets and personal assets. The mod will run using a Server and Custom Mod configuration files. Expected time 2-5 years. Plan to have a working test server in 6 months or less with a partial environment.

In approximately 5-10 years I expect to develop a DLC pack for UT2016 that can be downloaded and added to the game.

In approximately 10-20 years I will continue developing the DLC into a full working game based on UT2016 code bases

By the 25th year I would like to be releasing a relatively basic, but full game on Steam.
